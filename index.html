          I believe that developing software is an incredible way to help people, making their lives more agile and practical, while keeping an active mind and knowledge in constant renewal. I see the process of finding solutions to the difficulties, transforming them into software and continually improving it as one of the most fascinating things in the area of technology. I realized this when, working at Empresa Brasil de Comunicação (EBC), we developed a platform where employees could check their time sheet on a daily basis. The result of this transparency in the information was a drastic reduction of the conflicts between employees and company.
          I believe in continuing education, so I constantly invest in studies and updates. I just participated in the SheCodes initiative, organized by Matt Delac, where I spent a weekend learning and sharing knowledge with other women interested in the programming career. I finished this workshop with the certainty that diversity in the work and research fields, especially of technology, brings benefits to all. I’m also convinced that technology blends into all areas of life. Considering that I have been studying music and singing for some years, I see how these blended skills allowed me to reach out to people and touch them in some way.
